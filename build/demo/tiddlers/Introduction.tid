We are taught numbers are the symbols 0-9 in strings 111 == one hundred and eleven - 
but our sense of number are not like this - we are only directly aware of very small numbers (I will call these actual numbers or Anumbers) - 2,3,4,5 (for most people) - this sense is called suberting. We can also see the direct relationships between these small numbers 2cups+2saucers=4things! for instance. Arithmetic is then the development of these direct perceptions to larger quantities. Arithmetic has developed over the millenia and given us our current system of calculation, which is I would say, one of the foundations of the modern world. However strings of symbol do not give us much in terms of understanding - there appears to be a semantic gap between Anumbers and our strings of arabic numerals. (numerals being representations of a number).

In what follows I try to address the issue of the semantic gap by developing the idea of iconic numerals - which can be used in place of our arabic (symbolic) numerals.
