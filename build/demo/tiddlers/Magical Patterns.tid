title: Magical Patterns
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Patterns are everywhere, we see them as forms in the shapes of trees, hear them in the songs of  birds. Our understanding of patterns enable us to plan when to plant crops, when to harvest.  From our species we observe the rise of new patterns: languages, style, games, events to celebrate, rules to be obeyed.  Collectively we call such 'culture'.

Some like to harness the power of pattern, and provide tools for us to use, and we create new structures and expand our abilities beyond our previous limits - thus we fly to the moon. However, the use of power-patterns is not general available to all, only a select few are provided with the keys to unlock their power, and of those it is rare to obtain transcendence and become a pattern-magician.
