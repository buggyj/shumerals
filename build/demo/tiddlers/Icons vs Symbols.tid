title: Icons vs Symbols
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In order to explain things we write shapes that we understand the meaning of. The roman alphabet being a popular system of shapes. Some other shapes can be 'pictures' of things we wish to convey ideas about (a diagram of a man on the mens toilet for example).
In this text a Symbol denotes a shape that, by convention, does not represent an idea by looking like that idea (eg the roman alphabet). Conversely, Icons, by there nature look like the idea we wish to convey and by convention are used that way.
