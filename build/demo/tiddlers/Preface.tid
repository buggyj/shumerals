The ideas for this work started while I was working in china. I decided to learn some Chinese and found the  Chinese pictograms fascinating.  In my free time I tried to improve my understanding of maths by studying calculational logic.

Soon after returning from china I read the book "born on a blue day" by Daniel Tammet, where he describes his abilities to visualize numbers. Shortly after this I started to represent numbers as pictograms and eventually shumerals came into existance.
